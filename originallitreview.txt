## Personal Statement and Goals:
As a Ph.D. Data Sciences student at the Harrisburg University of Science and Technology, I, Laurel Lord, hope to dedicate my dissertation to increasing conservation efforts within my home country of Saint Lucia. One aspect of my study will focus on bioacoustic surveys concerning ornithology. This concerns primary and secondary data collection for analysis on local birds.

The initial hypothesis concerns the accuracy of primary data collected by humans versus specialized equipment. It is hypothesized that special acoustic equipment would be more accurate in noting the quantity and diversity of birds in the area, than the practices of the local Forestry Department personnel. Additionally, one goal aims to utilize specialized equipment to record bird acoustics to map out areas of population densities; the related hypothesis would be that local bird populations may be effectively tracked through the strategic placement and monitoring of recorders.

Once this data has been collected, a few additional hypotheses may be pursued. One concerns the creation of a predictive model for local bird populations, utilizing the secondary data and the newly collected primary data. This will be achieved by reviewing older manually collected records and tabulating the acoustic data from specialized recorders. Also, this bioacoustic survey would facilitate the analysis of sounds surrounding "important bird areas" (IBAs); passive-acoustic monitoring can facilitate the detection of small yet possibly biologically meaningful measurements and the identification of sources of noise pollution that have an impact on local bird populations. This will involve the cross-referencing of various community development projects in areas with notable acoustic foot-prints, and species decline.

A final aspect of conservation pertains to the amelioration of citizen knowledge and concern about the local wildlife through active participation. It is hypothesized that the creation of a citizen science project, for the active monitoring of local birds, will present opportunities to inform and educate Saint Lucians. Such activity will involve a base knowledge-survey of school-age students and the creation of a publicly available bird-survey activity.
 
## Proposal Background:
As of 2005, over 10% of the Caribbean's avifauna (57 of 560 or more species) was considered globally threatened following the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria [@wege2005; @wege2008]. There are various threats to the local Saint Lucian wildlife that require timely quantifiable observation and investigation to ameliorate conditions. For example, natural disasters, such as hurricanes and severe storms have been on the rise globally and have had significant impacts on the Caribbean (particularly along the "Hurricane Belt" during the Atlantic Hurricane Season) [@anthony2008; @cambers1997beach; @kossin2008north; @lawrence1981atlantic; @waide1991summary; @wege2005; @wege2008; @wiley1993effects]. The increasing regularity of the manifestation of severe weather can have both direct and indirect impacts on avian populations; this often includes increased mortality, loss of nests, loss of food supplies, vulnerability to predation, geographic displacement of individuals, and subsequently increased conflict with humans [@anthony2008; @durrell_org; @diamond1973habitats; @simmonds_2019; @wauer1992effect; @wege2005; @wiley1993effects; @cox_oltermann_2018]. For example, in 1980, Hurricane Allen severely damaged forest habitats all over the Caribbean and was said to have damaged or destroyed over 80% of Saint Lucia'sforests [@anthony2008; @lambert1985; @lawrence1981atlantic]. 

While man-made physical pollution can be readily recognized, there are numerous forms of pollution, such as light and sound, that can have a substantial impact on local wildlife. Anthropogenic noise can cause chaos within environments. Effective communication is essential for survival. In nature, noises are utilized for various essential functions, including predators evasion, foraging, mating, and maintaining relationships within social groups; yet, clear communication is becoming increasingly difficult with issues such as road and air traffic noises (both light and sound) [@carrington_2017; @ortega2012chapter; @lallensack_2018; @goudarzi_2006; @warren2006urban; @rheindt2003impact; @perillo2017anthropogenic; @gil2014birds; @cianchetti2018conflicts; @poot2008green].

Agricultural expansion (particularly banana cultivation), free-range roaming livestock, residential, hotel and resort developments, and road construction are often causes of deforestation and habitat degradation that can impact Saint Lucia's dry forest, wet tropical forest, mangroves, littoral vegetation and wetlands [@anthony2008; @busscher2018land; @durrell_org; @diamond1973habitats; @lugo1981tropical; @terborgh1973chance]. Man-made issues have taken the form of several major construction projects and land grabbing within protected areas [@anthony2008; @busscher2018land]. These proposals have often approved by the government despite active citizen protests.
 
Take, for example, the tourism construction project of the "Pearl of the Caribbean" - a 700-acre horse racing track towards the south end of the island [@dart_2017; @khalil_2018; @kieckhefer-2016; @kieckhefer_2016]. Saint Lucia's National Day, December 13th, 2019, will serve as its official launch date; at that point, hundreds of acres will be leased to an affiliate of the China Horse Club, and the Hong Kong-based Desert Star Holdings Ltd (DSH), for 99 years [@stuart_2019]. Since its proposal in 2016, approval of this project faced highly contentious public backlash, and this continued to be highly protested for years; the "Pearl of the Caribbean" even sparked the creation of new conservation groups such as the Vieux Fort Concerned Citizens Coalition for Change (VFCCCC/ VF4Cs) [@dart_2017; @james_2018; @reynolds2017]. 

Yet, despite action from even the former Prime minister, in the form of threats to sue the local government for breach of the Finance Administration Act of Saint Lucia and the Citizenship by Investment Act, the project was ultimately approved, and many other projects continue to be considered [@khalil_2018; @nesheim_2018; @stuart_2018]. Citizens continue to express concern that local wildlife is not being diligently protected by the relevant authorities; there is worry that many valuable habitats are being haphazardly destroyed [@reynolds2017]. Unfortunately, the recognition of, and adherence to, environmental impact studies often seem shrouded by the government, and this lack of transparency raises questions about the rigorous enforcement of needed standards [@anthony2008; @reynolds2017].
 
As of 2002, the Forestry Department and the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust have been working on implementing a monitoring program for the Endangered White-breasted Thrasher throughout its Saint Lucian range; particular focus was stated to be paid to the habitat changes resulting from the hotel and resort development at Praslin Bay - the center of the species' abundance [@anthony2008]. Notably, as of 2007, a pilot project utilizing distance-sampling to determine the population of the vulnerable Saint Lucia Parrot (Amazona Versicolor) was field-tested by the Forestry Department and Durrell. The Amazona Versicolor and thrasher surveys included components to estimate populations of a few other forest bird species [@anthony2008].
 
While there have been some efforts towards bird conservation, so much more can, and should, be done in terms of adequately monitoring the local wildlife to ensure construction projects are being completed with sufficient conservation considerations [@iucn_2016]. For example, while the Amazona Versicolor, "Jacquot", has been officially protected since 1849, the related governmental legislation was mostly ignored until the Jacquot was made Saint Lucia's national bird in  1979 [@anthony2008; @durrell_org]. Later in 1980, there was government legislation for biodiversity conservation in Saint Lucia that included the Wildlife Protection Act (which provides for the protection of wildlife and the establishment of wildlife reserves) [@anthony2008; @durrell_org]. While the country's legislature serves as a useful tool, there have been requests for the modernization of documents [@lugo1985watershed]. Despite the need to monitor the local bird populations, details on the current procedures in place for monitoring local bird populations, particularly after natural disasters (and habitat destruction), are highly obscure; readily accessible public information appears to be limited.
 
Conservation efforts are also hindered by resource limitations. Representatives of the local Forestry Department have made official comments regarding resource limitations [@anthony2008]. The Saint Lucian Forestry Department has acknowledged that, apart from the Amazona Versicolor and White-breasted Thrasher, there has been limited knowledge of the other bird populations (local, globally threatened, or restricted-range birds) [@anthony2008]. There was also a discussion of the need to increase the monitoring frequency of variables that impact bird population activity; minimums of annual observations were stated [@anthony2008]. There was also a need to precisely quantify population statuses, monitor several species, and assess the impacts of invasive alien species [@anthony2008]. 

Due to the department's limited resources, it has historically sought external entities, such as the Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots (ACTP), to assist with breeding programs [@jeggo2000breeding; @actp; @ortiz2018bird]. In fact, Saint Lucia, and many other countries facing species endangerment issues, may unwittingly agree to external assistance from questionable sources; some of the sources claiming to be helpful sanctuaries, have been associated with claims of questionable sales-practices (of endangered-offspring), and policies of highly restrictive facility access [@cox_oltermann_2018; @cox-oltermann_2018]. 
 
Public appreciation of wildlife in Saint Lucia has much room for improvement by global standards. While citizens are becoming more concerned about the environment, due to the poor governmental transparency, the general public is often left uninformed of the need for sustainable construction through environmental impact studies. It has been suggested that better marketing of key issues may ameliorate conditions [@belleville_2004; @wille1991paul]. 

In the past, there were programs catered towards avian awareness in Saint Lucia; however, there may be a need for a more modern and participative campaign to improve conservation [@john2004migrant; @wille1991paul]. For example, Paul Butler has been pivotal in the country's (and region's) conservation activities [@lugo1985watershed; @wille1991paul]. In 1977, he estimated that only 100 to 150 Amazona Versicolor remained on the island, and so he became part of a unique conservation initiative that utilized strategic marketing to create a 10-year "Protection through Pride" education and awareness program; these efforts boosted the Amazona Versicolor's status as a precious national symbol [@iucn_2016; @durrell_org; @lugo1985watershed; @rare2019; @wille1991paul]. The effort aided in curbing bird hunting on the island [@belleville_2004; @christian1996parrot; @iucn_2016; @juniper2003parrots; @rare2019; @wille1991paul].

The public's support for the conservation of various local bird species is dependent on their understanding of the species' existence and current status[@cardak2009science; @clamsen2013knowledge; @feilen2018developing; @white2018birds; @wilson2005knowledge; @prokop2007; @prokop2008slovakian]. Therefore, the creation of programs for active public participation in conservation efforts is crucial. Citizen science programs help educate the public on environmental facts, inform them of the status of their surroundings and can inspire the pursuit of future occupations in industries that may benefit the environment[@bonney2016can; @catlin2012citizen; @cohn2008citizen; @earthwatch_institute2019; @kullenberg2016citizen; @louv2012citizen; @oberhauser2008citizen]. Active involvement, in the form of monitoring nature and reviewing related materials, would aid in boosting human resource levels for primary data collection, as well as improve education (with regards to critical thinking and analytic skills of citizens [@bonney2016can; @catlin2012citizen; @cohn2008citizen; @earthwatch_institute2019; @kullenberg2016citizen; @louv2012citizen; @oberhauser2008citizen]. 

For example, the UK's Big Garden Birdwatch is facilitated by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB); this annual event serves as the world's most comprehensive wildlife citizen survey mapping program and continues to change the fortunes of Britain's bird populations [@barkham_2019; @bbc_2019; @catlin2012citizen; @kirkhope2010social; @lawrence2010personal; @rspb_2019; @wilson2012big]. Saint Lucia would also benefit from the fact that environmentally conscious citizens may act as more informed consumers, capable of altering their purchasing-patterns based on a company's social and environmental reputation [@borin_cerf_krishnan_2011; @butler_2018; @iglesias2019customer].

Unfortunately, many Caribbean countries still lack the necessary infrastructure and resources needed for extensive scientific observation of their environment. This lack of study fosters misinformed choices at various levels of society. Facts - quantifiable data - have been viewed as the unignorable linchpins of many meaningful modern changes.
 
I hope to conduct and present quantifiable studies of the environment in Saint Lucia, with the end goal of increasing public appreciation of the wildlife. I hope to reach more concrete conclusions on the status of the bird wildlife (particularly endemic species) and include an aspect of public participation (citizen science) to cement a positive change moving forward.


## Methodology and Current Progress:
Once again, an initial hypothesis would investigate the accuracy of primary data collected by humans versus specialized equipment, and another would use specialized equipment to observe bird acoustics to map out areas of bird population densities; this would be followed by the creation of a predictive model for local bird populations (based on the historical data and newly collected primary data), and passive-acoustic monitoring for noise-pollution. This academic journey would begin by first analyzing the secondary data already collected by the local wildlife authorities. There are set areas in Saint Lucia dubbed as "important bird areas" (IBAs) [@anthony2008]. These areas would be North-east coast (Dauphin, Dennery), the Government Forest Reserve (Anse-La-Raye, Babonneau, Cannaries, Dennery, Laborie, Micoud, Soufriere), Pitons Management Area (Choiseul, Soufriere), Mandele Dry Forest (Dennery, Praslin), and Points Sables National Park (Vieux Fort) [@anthony2008]. Moreover, I have been informed of a 2008 biophysical report (with supplementary data). This report included the status of various species from set coordinates of over 201 plots maintained by the local wildlife authorities. These areas and information are accessible upon request. 

Analyzing this data would allow one to determine which areas would be most ideal for the placement of monitoring equipment. Despite the availability of 201 plots, it may not be possible to visit all of them since the timeframe and resources for this project are limited. Advise is currently being sought to determine adequate quantities and spacing of units; further research is required for the creation of an optimization formula/theory to justify judgments.

For now, five sites are planned to be monitored for the collection of primary data; this will allow for the comparision of the accuracy of man versus machine documentation, and to map the avian wildlife population clusters through acoustics. Focusing on endemic populations, like the Amazona Versicolor, may be more useful as a smaller scope to help limit the project and limit issues with migrational pattern considerations. Therefore,  I would need to utilize specialized equipment (that I will be supplying) to monitor the avian activity of these sites over at least three months. This equipment would be Cornell's Bioacoustics Research Program's Swift recorder units. The sounds detected by the equipment would then be analyzed utilizing specialized software.
 
The analysis would assist in identifying different bird species. I would then compare the results to the historical avian records. I would also compare these details to intermittent low-tech point-and-count records (this primary data collection would be conducted intermittently during the same timeframe as the acoustic recordings).
 
## Base Equipment:
The Swift recorder was suggested as a useful, long-term lease, tool for monitoring bird populations in the tropics for extended periods. Although this equipment is moderately new, the Swift recorder has already been utilized in several publications [@fournet2019; @wood2019acoustic; @wood2019detecting]. Below are some equipment details from their Deborah Cipolla-Dennis (the Manager of Bioacoustics Research Program):
 
*Use*:  Two types of units are offered; these are Standard and Rugged. The Standard units are recommended for most applications because the recording quality is better due to the external microphone, and are weatherproof. Rugged units are more applicable to situations requiring longer recording schedules, therefore, they are the preferred option for this task's extensive observation period.
 
*Cost*: The Standard units cost $250, and the Rugged units that utilize 6 D-cell batteries are $300 per unit; Rugged units that use 12 D-cell batteries are $310 per unit. The lessee is responsible for shipping, customs, duties, and taxes. Once again, the Rugged unit, though more costly, may be preferred due to the extensive observation period.

*Additional Needs*: Each unit will require D-cell batteries (3, 6, or 12) and a SD card. Panasonic Industrial batteries and the SanDisk Extreme Pro SD card are recommended.
 
*Note*: It is highly challenging to estimate the recording range. This includes the consideration of differing variables, such as the amplitude of the focal species, the environmental conditions (wind, temp, moisture), and the ambient noise in the area. Local ornithologists from the Saint Lucian Forestry Department have been contacted for further insight into the conditions that may impact the geographical distribution of Swift units and to better estimate the number of units that are needed. Five units are estimated to be required thus far, and these units can be shipped out within 1 to 2 weeks after receiving an order.

## Timeframe:
According to the migrant bird records for Saint Lucia, observations of such avian activity is preferably conducted from the Fall to Spring migration period of September to May; however, the best time to observe local avian activity would be throughout their mating season [@john2004migrant]. Such peak times were said to be from January to April, and again from August to September. My preference would have been the latter; however, this does not align with the remaining period of my studies. Therefore, the January to April peak may be the best option. The use of Swift recorders could begin as early as December to establish controls and non-peak mating seasons. 


## Sustainability:
*Citizen Science*:
One final hypothesis considers that native support for the conservation of local bird diversity is reliant upon their cognizance and concern of the species' existence and their current status[@cardak2009science; @clamsen2013knowledge; @feilen2018developing; @white2018birds; @wilson2005knowledge; @prokop2007; @prokop2008slovakian]. A questionnaire would be presented to gauge the public's base knowledge and concern for bird species. This simple questionnaire with fewer than ten questions would be presented to local students and their teachers; students would include primary-school and secondary-school levels. Testing educational institutions would facilitate the convenient distribution of materials and the collection of data from a large population; these schools would serve as an ideal educational receptive environment. This environment would also conveniently gauge the youth's knowledge and thus provide insight into what resources may be needed to improve longer-term conservation efforts. Presenting teachers with questionnaires would provide valuable feedback from adult perspectives (albeit based on one profession) [@torkar2006trainee]. *This would be an active joint project with the local Education Department and the Forestry Department. The necessary authority figures have been contacted, and the approval forms for testing at these educational facilities will be reviewed and processed by the Education Department.*

Additionally, it is hoped that the creation of a publicly interactive online bird survey would serve to improve public awareness and appreciation for the local wildlife and conservation efforts. The local Forestry Department is expected to be a collaborator in the organization of this nationwide birding event. Citizens would be encouraged to log their bird sightings for the day. 

An "event day" is planned for the launch of the website. This will be very similar to the UK's annually conducted Big Garden Birdwatch. RSPB experts, present in Saint Lucia, have been contacted. December 13th (Saint Lucian National Day), was selected as a fitting launch date for such an activity. This date is significant enough to garner ample public attention and participation. Moreover, the significance of this date should be more recognizable than other bird-themed observations like International Migratory Bird Day. Saint Lucian National Day would allow for better participation of local people as it is a national holiday that coincides with school vacations. 

Additionally, two TV news stories and radio announcements can be created to promote the activity, in addition to a few simple flyers being posted at local main commerce buildings. A local news anchor (and environmental activist) has provided insight into the intricacies of such a request. Ultimately, at least one of the two main TV/ radio stations in Saint Lucia island is willing to assist with free publicity for the event [@hts_news].
 
This activity, like the bird monitoring activity, would also be available for three months, and then data logged would be analyzed later. While the official launch will be on December 13th, a soft-conclusion will occur as of March 31st to allow for proper analysis. However, this website could be run beyond that time if necessary.


*Work is currently being conducted to complete the interactive citizen-science web-portal.*
*This is a simplified explanation of my plans. I can indeed elaborate upon these plans where necessary.*
