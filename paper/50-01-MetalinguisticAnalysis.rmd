## Metalinguistic Analysis

The MANOVA that examined the difference among the 4 variables of intrest found the joint distrobution to have a statisticaly significant effect:
$F$(`r meta$mv_tab[2,4]`, `r meta$mv_tab[2,5]`) = `r round(meta$mv_tab[2,3], 3)` ($p$ `r apa_pvalue(meta$mv_tab[2,6])`) with an effect size of Partial $\eta^{2}$ = `r round(meta$mv_eta, 3)`.
Table \@ref(tab:metaunivariateresults) presents the means, standard deviations, and follow-up univariate ANOVA Bonferroni adjusted results on the 4 variables.

The subsequent univariate ANOVAs on the 4 variables identified all 4 variables that significantly discriminated between groups. While all the differences _are_ statisticaly significant, only Paragraphs and MATTR1k represent a practical level of signifiance that a human might notice without macheine assistance.
