After the corpus was collected and converted to plain text, it was tokenized using the NLTK's ^[http://www.nltk.org] implementation of the Punkt sentence tokenizer [@kiss2006unsupervised] followed by the Penn Treebank word tokenizer [@marcus1993building].
Punkt was chosen as it has proven viable in several other works [@hiippala2016semi;@avramidis2011evaluate;@yao2014information;@nothman2013learning;@marrese2014novel].
Laboreiro et al. notes that while the Penn Treebank may have some issues, it is still the de-facto standard [@laboreiro2010tokenizing].

### Linguistic variables analyzed

This paper investigated several dependent variables.
Overall document cadence was captured using mean words per sentence, mean sentances per paragraph, and mean paragraphs per document.
Lexical diversity was captured using a moving average type-token ratio (MATTR) [@covington2010cutting] with a window size 1000.

#### Basic

What collection of characters are recognised as distinct from one another may differ depending on the research at hand.
In order to maxmize reproduceability, this paper adopts the defnitions of words and sentences presented by tokenizers listed above [@kiss2006unsupervised;@marrese2014novel].
Two neiboring sentences are said to come from distinct paragraphs if they are seperated by at least one blank line.

#### Type-token ratio

A type-token ratio is simple to compute measure of word diversity inside of a single document [@hill2015real].
However, it suffers from the need to standardise on document length [@covington2010cutting;@kettunen2014can;@jarvis2002short;@richards1987type].
A moving average type-token ratio helps address these issues [@covington2010cutting;@kettunen2014can].

#### Statistical analyses

The measures were extracted from the corpus then analysied using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) approach.
The total number of documents in the corpus was N = `r dim(meta$metadata)[1]`.
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ were left at their traditional levels.
